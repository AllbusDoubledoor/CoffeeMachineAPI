# CoffeeMachineAPI
Solution for an exercise about REST-service that emulates a coffee machine:
User can request a cup of coffee, coffee machine should return the cup and update it's state in accordance with ammounts of materials left
User can add water, milk, beans to the machine or perform machine cleaning

One cup of capuchino uses: 150ml of water, 100ml of Milk, 15mg of coffee beans

If there isn't enougth materials coffee machine should return an error and ask for water, milk, beans or cleaning
Once per 8 cups the machine requires cleaning
Coffee machine can hold 2 liters of water, 1 liter of milk and 100mg of coffee beans, if user tries to put into it more than possible there should be an overflow error (input validation)

Try to write clean and maintanable code, aply KISS, DRY, YAGNI principles
Specifiy documentation as if somebody else would integrate with this API
Write tests as you see fit
For additional points you can add additional options of coffee types (americano, espresso)
